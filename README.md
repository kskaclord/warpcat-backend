WarpCat Traits v1
==================
Place the 'traits' and 'assets' folders directly under your project root:
  warpcat-backend/
    index.js
    package.json
    traits/
    assets/

- 'traits' contains JSON definitions and rarity.
- 'assets' should contain SVG parts for each trait type. (currently empty)
